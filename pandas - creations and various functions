pandas is a python library  that allows us to easily read and work with the different types of data so we can use this to analyze csv files excel and other similar formats.

import pandas as pd      # importing pandas as pd
df                      # stands for DataFrame
df.shape                # give you the shape of the pandas with the exact rows and columns
df.info                 # provides you the information regarding the dataframe
df.head(10)              #give you the first 10 rows and columns
df.tail(10)              # give you the last 10 rows and columns


--->creataing a dataframes


people = {
        "first" : ["anu","sneha","raunak"],
        "last" : ["rawat","singh","sambharwal"],
         "email" : ["anurawat@gmail.com","snehasingh@gmail.com","raunaksambharwal@gmail.com"]
}

df  = pd.DataFrame(people)
df


people['email']                            ['anurawat@gmail.com', 'snehasingh@gmail.com', 'raunaksambharwal@gmail.com']
type(people['email'])                      list

 
 
df['email']               
type(['email'])                         pandas.core.series.Series

----->accesing multiple columns
df[['last','email']]  #show you the last with all the emails with its

---->iloc:  iloc is used for integer indexing
iloc is used to access the rows by  integer locations
df.iloc[0]
df.iloc[[0,1]]
df.iloc[[0,1],2]


--->loc : loc is typically used for label indexing and can access multiple columns.
df.loc[[0,1]]
